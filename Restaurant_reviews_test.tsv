Hello. Please give our thanks to the Manager(s) and others for the wonderful room and bottle of sparkling wine for our Anniversary stay. We had an amazing time. The room was so comfortable, the food at Echo absolutely spectacular (we ate two meals there). Our waitress was just wonderful. Looking forward to staying with you in the future. What a great place!	1

I had lunch with some of my colleagues at Echo on Day 1. I had the wedge salad - it was delicious. On Night 2, I enjoyed a drink at the bar. I had a Margarita. The service was excellent.	1

Had dinner with girl friends. Menu is perfect, something for everyone. Service was awesome and Jason was very accommodating. Will be back definitely!	1
Visited as a guest in the Echo restaurant for lunch just today. We were entertaining friends from California, and enjoyed our ocean side table. We chose to stay indoors - to enjoy the air conditioning ðŸ˜Š. I just want to say that, in addition to a nice meal, we had a delightful waitress, Jackie. She had just the right balance of friendliness and efficiency. She recognized that we wanted time to visit and did not rush us. She and other staff members made certain that we had everything we needed. Kudos!	1
We had lunch here a few times while on the island visiting family and friends. The servers here are just wonderful and have great memories it seems. We sat on the ocean front patio and enjoyed the view with our delicious wine and lunch. Must try!	1
Although we didn't go into the onsite restaurant, we ordered some food at the bar a few times and it was delicious. The bar area and lobby were nice and open, good place to relax and meet friends.	1
